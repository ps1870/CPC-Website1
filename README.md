Information that needs to be added to the site:
1. Media, Financial and Technology for all countries 
2. Information for the USA
3. Information for the compare tool (more or less a copy and paste of what is already on the page dedicated for that country)

How to host the website

There are many ways to do this and tutorials available online, but GitHub allows you to do this for free (I linked a short and easy video on how to do it below)

I suggest hosting the website and then adding the rest of the information 

**All these files need to be moved to another GitHub account to edit and host the website**

How and what files should be edited 

1. The files can be edited on GitHub (look for the pencil icon on the page)

2. To edit a country's page go to countries folder, select the country and edit the HTML file ONLY

3. To edit the compare page, go to the compare folder, and then data.js
